2025-07-23 05:38:53,301 - INFO - <think> The image shows a spaceship moving through space, passing by a nebula and a planet. The camera is likely panning or tracking the spaceship as it moves through the scene. There is no indication of a tilt or roll, so option A can be ruled out. Option B (tilt up) would not fit the context of the spaceship moving through space. Option C (pull out) suggests the camera is zooming out, which is not evident here. Therefore, the most likely answer is D (tilt down), but since there is no tilt, the correct answer is C (pull out). </think> <answer>C</answer>
