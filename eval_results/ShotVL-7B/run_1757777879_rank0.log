The shot size is wide, encompassing multiple subjects and significant portions of the environment, further supporting the aerial nature. The high vantage point and the scale of the shot relative to the subjects on the yacht also align with the aerial genre.

The shot is not high enough to be considered overhead, as the subjects are clearly visible and not just as silhouettes. The shot is not low, as the camera is not looking down at the subjects from a high angle, but rather capturing them from above at a moderate height. The shot is not wide, as the term 'wide' typically implies more spatial context than is present here, where the shot is still focused on the yacht and its immediate surroundings. The shot is not extreme wide, as the extreme wide shot would encompass even more of the environment, including more of the distant landmasses and the full expanse of the ocean, which is not the case here.</think>
